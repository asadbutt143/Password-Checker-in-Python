# Password Strength Checker

This Python script assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It provides feedback to the user on the password's strength.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
3. Run the script using Python:
4. Enter a password when prompted. The script will provide feedback on the strength of the password.
5. To exit the program, type 'exit' when prompted for a password.

## Criteria for Password Strength Assessment

The strength of the password is assessed based on the following criteria:

- **Length**: Passwords with a length of 8 characters or more are considered stronger.
- **Uppercase Letters**: Presence of at least one uppercase letter adds to the password strength.
- **Lowercase Letters**: Presence of at least one lowercase letter adds to the password strength.
- **Digits**: Presence of at least one digit (0-9) adds to the password strength.
- **Special Characters**: Presence of at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*) adds to the password strength.

## Examples of Password Strength Levels

- **Weak**: Passwords with a strength score below 8.
- **Moderate**: Passwords with a strength score between 8 and 11.
- **Strong**: Passwords with a strength score of 12 or higher.

## Notes

- This script is for educational purposes and demonstrates a basic password strength assessment algorithm. It may not cover all possible cases or provide a foolproof assessment.
- Use strong and unique passwords to protect your accounts and sensitive information.
